        <h6 class="name" id="SCA">SCA</h6>
        <p>It is so he understands this matter. He only wants you as his
            wife, and I am not a man to have mixed in this business if he had
            meant anything else.</p>
        <h6 class="name" id="ZER">ZER</h6>
        <p>I believe it since you say so; but I foresee certain 
            difficulties with the father.</p>
        <h6 class="name" id="SCA">SCA</h6> 
        <p>We shall find a way of settling that.</p>
        <h6 class="name" id="HYA">HYA</h6> <p>(_to_ ZERBINETTE)</p>
        <p>The similarity of our fate ought to 
            strengthen the tie of friendship between us. We are both subject to 
            the same fears, both exposed to the same misfortune.</p>
        <h6 class="name" id="ZER">ZER</h6> 
        <p>You have this advantage at least that you know who your parents 
            are, and that, sure of their help, when you wish to make them known,
            you can secure your happiness by obtaining a consent to the marriage 
            you have contracted. But I, on the contrary, have no such hope to 
            fall back upon, and the position I am in is little calculated to 
            satisfy the wishes of a father whose whole care is money.</p> 
        <h6 class="name" id="HYA">HYA</h6> <p>That is true; but you have this in your favour, that the one 
            you love is under no temptation of contracting another marriage.</p>
